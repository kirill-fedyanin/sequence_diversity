      "Answer: Arteries and veins both carry blood, but veins have the added job of carrying blood from your capillaries and tissues back to your heart for oxygenation. Oxygenated blood is rich in red blood cells, so veins appear red as a result of the blood flowing through them. While veins carry carbon dioxide-rich blood (the byproduct of respiration) away from your organs, the veins in the lower body also contain a thin layer of white blood cells. This results in a deeper blue-tint. We see the blue because of a chemical reaction that occurs between oxygen and the molecules in your skin and in the blood.\n",
