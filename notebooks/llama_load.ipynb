Most airlines will also add a chemical that will speed up the rate at which these condensation trails break apart, so that they are less persistent in the air. It also will cause any airline to make any and all possible safety adjustments (if necessary) to their airplanes, to limit the emission of plane vapor into the atmosphere, in order to help minimize any effect on global warming, and to comply with any new laws enacted by any country regarding the amount of vapor released by their planes into the atmosphere.\n",
